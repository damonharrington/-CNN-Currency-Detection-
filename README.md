Building an CNN model for Currency Detection
# Description:
This repository presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting and classifying currencies. The project aims to demonstrate the application of deep learning in image classification tasks, specifically for identifying currency notes based on their features.

# Features:
Data Preprocessing: Processes images of currency notes to ensure they are suitable for model training and testing.
Model Architecture: Implements a CNN designed to extract visual features and classify currencies accurately.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes accuracy, confusion matrices, and other metrics to measure model performance.
Real-World Application: Suitable for use cases such as automated cash counting, counterfeit detection, or assisting visually impaired individuals.
